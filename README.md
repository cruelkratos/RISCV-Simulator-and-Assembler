# RISCV-Simulator-and-Assembler
A simulator for RISC-V instruction execution(A Single Cycle CPU) and an assembler for conversion of the assembly code to machine encodings using the instruction set with a cache sim.

This project is a part of my coursework for the course CSN-221 ( Computer Architecture and Microprocessors)
