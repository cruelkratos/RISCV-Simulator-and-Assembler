# RISCV-Simulator-and-Assembler
A simulator for RISC-V instruction execution  and an assembler for conversion of the assembly code to machine encodings using the instructions with a cache sim.

This project was part of my coursework for the course CSN-221 ( Computer Architecture and Microprocessors)
