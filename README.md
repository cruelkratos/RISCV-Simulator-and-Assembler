# RISC-V Assembler and Simulator
This project is a RISC-V assembler and simulator implemented in C++. It is designed to help you write, assemble, and execute RISC-V assembly programs. The assembler converts human-readable RISC-V assembly code into machine encodings, while the simulator executes these encodings, allowing you to test your RISC-V programs.
