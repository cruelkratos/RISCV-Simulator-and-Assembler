# Assembler

The assembler is a CLI program designed to translate assembly language instructions into their corresponding binary representations. It takes input from a file named "instruction.txt" and produces output in a file named "encoded.txt." The assembler is primarily intended for converting a specific set of RISC-V assembly instructions into binary machine code.


## Installation

Compile and Run with G++20

```bash
  g++ -o assemble assembler.cpp 
  .\a.out (or .\a.exe depending upon OS)
```
